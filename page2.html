	<p> The war between the Orcs and Elves rage on. Peace seem so far from reach, and both races too proud to ever consider surrender-</p>
	<u><p><em>no no that's such a boring concept... also really clique. Why should Orcs and Elves fight anyways? Nah let me see...how about uuuummmm...</em></p></u>
	
	<p><strong>"Teach me how to be like you!" The elf exclaimed at the orc; seemingly unfazed by such a decleration. Brothbard huffed in amusement "I admire your desire to better yourself Lucian."</strong></p>
	<p>"However..."Brothbard's face turned stoic, though it always seemed stoic, puffing out is already <strong>ripped</strong> chest. He loomed over Lucian "Why do you want to achive such a goal?"</p>
	<u><p><em>why would an Elf want to be ripped?hmm... OH! He wants to be a gladiator and fight in the ring!</em></p></u>
	
	
	<p><strong>"I WANT TO BE A GLADIATOR!"</strong>Lucian for some reason descided to be standing on a rock whilst he stood he made his decleration.</p>
	<p>Most likely to meet Brothbard's gaze. "But <strong>WHY</strong>?!"</p>
	<u><p><em>because his mom was ripped apart by a werewolf</em></p></u>
	<p>"my... mother lost her life to a lycan.</p>
	
	<u><p><em> he wasn't strong enough wich is why he needs to get stronger and take his revenge</em></p></u>
	<p><em>I-I wasn't strong enough then...</em><strong>That's why I need to get stronger! </strong>" tears flowed down his face, but the look of determination burned brightly</p>
	<p>Brothbard grimiced "Young one." he placed one large clawe hand on Lucian "Vengance is digging a grave for two. Do you really have what it takes to see this through... to the bitter end?"</p>
	<u><p><em>he does</em></p></u>
	<p>with hardend eyes Lucian responds "<strong>more than enough.</strong>"</p>
	
	
	
	<p> with that the two shook hands; sealing their <a href="index.html"> fat-</a></p>
